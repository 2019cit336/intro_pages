        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <p>
           Im a Senior at Pace University finishing up my last semester and (hopefully) graduating in May. I live off campus on Long Island.
           Incase anyone was curious, my profile picture is the logo from the game Persona 5 with a twist. Since each game in the series has a dominant color, I took the Logo from Persona 5 and combined it with the primary color from Persona 4 to pay homage to both of my favotie games in the franchise.
