        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
           Hi! My name is Kristen, I'm a senior here at Pace NYC. I'm in Lubin, majoring in Information Systems & minoring in Special EventsMarketing. I was born and raised in Queens, NY. I have a dog who just turned 3. Her name is Coco and she's a Maltese/Cocker Spaniel/Poodle mix. I love adventures and am always up for trying something new.

        <h3>Experience</h3>
       
            <p>Since I was a sophomore, I've been working on campus as a CIS 101 tutor.</p>
            <p>I recently started interning part time at a public relations agency in midtown Manhattan.</p>
            <p>Last year, I interned at a nonprofit organization within their development department.</p>
            <p>A few summers ago I worked as a receptionist at Russell Reynolds Associates.</p>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
            My biggest goal in life is to travel all over the world and possibly live abroad. I've always loved traveling and I've been fortunate to do a lot of it already. 
            I would also like to publish a novel at some point in my life. It's something I've wanted to do since I was in the second grade and I'd really like to see it through (no idea what it would be about though!).
