                    Hi! My name is Eric and I'm currently a junior working towards my BS in Information Technology. Some of my interests and hobbies include watching tv (Bobs Burgers is my favorite), discovering new music, going to the gym, cooking, playing with pets (proud dog dad myself), arts and crafts, and exploring the city among plenty others.

                <h1>Experience</h1>
                <p>
                    To be honest, my experience is pretty limited in this field. I love technology and learning to code, making websites, and generating my own mockups but since majority of the knowledge I've obtained is self-taught, I haven't had much experience other than a few courses at Pace and some projects I've come up with on my own and worked on in my spare time. Some samples of my work from other courses can be found <a href="http://webpage.pace.edu/ea98277n">here</a>, and I also have a few other websites like <a href="http://backslash.io">backslash</a> (my personal website) and <a href="http://fork.to">fork</a> (a cryptocurrency-related project idea) that I'm hoping to get up and running by the end of the semester as well. Languages I've worked with that I can say I understand relatively well are just HTML and CSS, but I have dabbled in JavaScript, php, and SQL before so they aren't completely new to me either.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>Goals</h1>
                <p>
                    To be able to do something useful with my code! I've been designing and playing with code since the days of MySpace (how I got involved with coding to begin with), and I desperately want to bring my skills to the next level so the code can do something other than just customizing and making things look pretty. I'd love to learn more about php and implementing databases, or more information relating to frameworks and CMS systems.. maybe more about WordPress or Drupal. Anything that gets the code to become more purposeful really is a goal for me :)
