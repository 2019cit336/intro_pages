        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>Currently I am taking some UX courses and obtained a lot of skills in the design of an application. I have learned both the qualitative and quantitative research that is required to design an application that people would enjoy. I have conducted and lead surveys and interviews to get an insight on how people use and interact with applications. Understanding how people interact with applications has given me a good understanding in what it takes to make a good app.
