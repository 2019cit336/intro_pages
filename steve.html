<h2>About Me</h2> 
<p>Hey everyone. My name is Steve Hemberger and I am a Junior here at Pace. I am a commuter and live only a few miles from campus.
<br>I am an Information Systems major, and though I've taken Web Authoring and Design, that is about the extent of my coding exprience. 
<br>I work in IT doing basic helpdesk and can't wait to move on to more complex areas in this field. I am looking forward to working with all of you!
