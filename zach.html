        <h2>My Bio</h2>
        <p>
           I am a junior IT major with a minor in Environmental Studies. I am originally from Ohio but wanted to move to New York for the oppurtunities it has here. 
           I am also very passionate about the Enviroment and my goal is to find work that combines both the IT and Environmental fields. 
           I currently work at the apple store and have been working there for about 9 months. 
           Other than work and school I like to skateboard on an electric board and go hiking.

            I have worked in a medium sized buisness's IT department doing help desk tickets, mainly involving printers. Luckily by the end of the internship they began implementation of a paperless system that I helped customize.
            I am currently doing web design for a magazine company working on creating a new site and updating an exisiting site.
