            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>
                I'm currently a Junior at Pace University Pleasantville campus. I have a major in Information Technology and a minor in Psychology. 
                I am the co-founder and President of Pace Original Style Etiquette (POSE) which is a fashion club at the Pleasantville campus as well as the President of Students Of Caribbean Awareness (SOCA).
                I manage all this while still being a commuter student. On my spare time I really like watching movies, which is why like the majority of other millenials, I have a subscription to a majority of the streaming services. 
                I'm also the manager of a Regal Cinemas which allows me to be surrounded by the talk of movies at all times. 
                Other than this, I'm really interested in cars and fashion. Learning and knowing about all the different models of cars and the whole car culture in general. 
                All the work I have done to my car, I have done it in my driveway with my friends and learning as we go. 
                Now when it comes to fashion, I take pride in how I dress and I am always paying attention to all the new trends. This plays a big role in why I wanted to start a fashon club on campus.

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                I am really interested in how people think and act when it comes to communication with others and their environment. 
                I would like to incorporate the IT side of things with the psychology by studying how heavy incorporation of technology on our society affects how individuals interact with each other.
                For instance how the design of websites and the images and colors used makes the viewers feel. However, I would like to be more specific on how this influx of technology on this generation affects their interaction with other individuals and the world around them.
