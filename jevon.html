			<!-- Bio -->
				<h2>Hey! My name is Jevon Cowell!</h2>
				<p> I'm a Fullish Time "Junior" majoring for a BA in Computer Science.
          			I'm from way uptown Bronx and travel to Manhattan daily for work and classes.
          			I enjoy creating Eletric Skateboards, Playing Super Smash Bros (I suck though), and hanging with friends!
                I'm excited in learning on web scripting techniquies since I'm more of a Backend guy.

				<h2>Experience</h2>
				<p>
          I don't have much expereince when it comes to front end developement (HTML, Javascript, CSS, etc).
          I do more backend stuff like designing and setting up Databases and making SQL Queries.
          I've mosty done indepenedent apps ( that I abandoned very quickly when im overwhelmed)
          and haven't done anyhting code intesive since last year ( think I didn't sleep for 4 days)

				<!-- Goal Paragraph-->
				<h2>In the future</h2>
				<p>
          I'm not sure what I want at the end of this (and by this i mena college and life).
          Right now in the "comfy zone" of things so I don't really think of any thing ambitious.
          Just going witht he flow.
