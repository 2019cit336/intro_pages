		<p>
            I transfered to Pace Univeristy from Dutchess Community College in 2017 with an Associates in Business Administration. 
            I am now graduating this May with a B.B.A in Information Systems. 
            I decided to switch my major because I love coding, troubleshooting, and learning new software applications in businesses. 
            I live off campus in Wappingers Falls so my commute time to Pleasantville is about 50 minutes.  
            My hobbies include dancing, gaming, and listening to music.
