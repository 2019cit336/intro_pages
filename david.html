                <p>Hello!, my name is David. I am a student at Pace University, studying Information Technology.
                    I currently work as a IT support technician at an electrical contracting company 
                    in Queens. I live in Huntington NY, but I grew up in rural central Pennsylvania.  
                </p>
                <p>I am not particulrly skilled in web design, so excuse my lack
                    of css skills. A long time ago I was more interested in web development
                    but I don't really do it anymore. You can see some of my old work
