        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
           I am returning to school after being in the professional industry for over 20 years.  I was in the military for 
		   13 of those years and I was lucky enough to make it to Afghanistan and back during that time.  I was a Satellite Systems Operator/Maintainer and functioned as a subject
           matter expert while on deployment.  It may surprize some people to know that I am a motorcycle rider and that is my bike in the photo.  I am
           Originally from Louisiana, but I have also lived in Colorado for a fairly good portion of my later life.  I am finishing up my BS degree and going 
           straight into my MS, but it is currently still a mystery as to what Pace wants to classify me as. I've managed to navigate my way around a few obstacles and 
           kept things interesting and entertaining during the meantime.
